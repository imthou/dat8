###Will discuss in-class on Monday, Sept. 28!

Dataset: ex1-chicagohouseprices.csv. "House Prices" is a list of homes sold in Chicago. "Neighborhood Information" contains broad demographic data for each neighborhood.

Question

What is the price of 1342 N Leavitt Street? It's located in Wicker Park, a single-family home with two baths. The home is a 10-minute drive from the loop at 3.96 miles to Lake Michigan. The local crime index is 3.76 and the local school index is 16.7. The house is 116 years old. The lot size is 3,049 sqft and the house size is 3,154 sqft.


Using Pandas and Jupyter:

1. Investigate the dataset by asking questions and answering them. Try to predict the answer to your question and see if the results confirm it. If not, investigate. Are there any "interesting" things you found out about the data? Something is interesting if it is unexpected. For example, you may find a pattern, data that is different than you expect, etc.

2. Now that you better understand the dataset, try to answer the question.

3. Argue that your answer is a good prediction by using validation, statistical, or graphical techniques.
